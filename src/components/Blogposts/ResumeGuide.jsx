            Your resume is more than a piece of paper (or PDF document) of your experience — it&apos;s a personal sales pitch. Whether you&apos;re a student looking for a co-op/internship or just entering the workforce, a great resume can be the key to unlocking career opportunities and differentiating yourself from others in the screening process. However, writing a resume that effectively highlights your skills and experiences is hard. This guide will walk you through the essentials of building a resume that stands out, provide practical tips, and help you align your resume with what recruiters, hiring managers, and team members are looking for.

            The content of your resume should:

              <ul className='bulleted_list'>
                <li><strong>Not have grammatical error</strong> - Typos and poor grammar can appear unprofessional, so proofread your resume multiple times and have someone else review it</li>
                <li><strong>Not exceed one page</strong> - As a student or someone with minimal experience, a one-page resume ensures reviewers can quickly assess your qualifications while you keep your content relevant to the job or industry</li>
                <li><strong>Not include images</strong> - Avoid images or extensive graphics as they don&apos;t provide useful information and take up space that could be better used for valuable details</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            The structure of your resume should include the following:

              <ul className='bulleted_list'>

                <li><strong>Education</strong> - Degree, university, and graduation date</li>
                <li><strong>Skills</strong> - Tools, knowledge, or technical skills relevant to your field</li>
                <li><strong>Experience</strong> - Co-ops/internships, student organizations, or any job relevant to your field</li>
                <li><strong>Projects</strong> - Personal, academic, or extracurricular projects that showcase your abilities</li>

            Eye-tracking studies show that people scan documents in an F-shaped pattern (<a className='link' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://tracigardner.github.io/TechComm/document-design/page--f-shaped-reading-pattern.html'>you can read about it here</a>), primarily scanning across the top and down the left side. This means that the structure of your resume is crucial in determining what information gets noticed first. Since a person will read across the top and then down the left side, the content that gets the most attention are the first few words of each section and bullet point. To optimize for this, structure your resume so that key details (job titles, companies, impact-driven statements, and measurable results) appear in those areas. Also ensure that your bullet points start with a strong action verb that best describes your experiences and accomplishments (<a className='link' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://hls.harvard.edu/bernard-koteen-office-of-public-interest-advising/opia-job-search-toolkit/action-verbs/'>Harvard Law School has a great list of action verbs</a>).

            Crafting a great resume involves more than just listing your experiences and what you&apos;ve done. Your main goal is to stand out. This can be achieved by tailoring your resume to a job role or industry, showcasing your value, and ensuring your resume reads easily to recruiters, hiring managers, and team members.
          </p>

          <section id='standing-out'>
            <h4 className='blogpost__section__title'>The Goal: Standing Out</h4>
            <p>
              A strong resume isn&apos;t just a list of experiences, it should clearly showcase your value and make you stand out. Tailor it to the job or industry, highlight your most relevant skills, and ensure it&apos;s easy for recruiters, hiring managers, and team members to read.
              <br />
              <br />
              Depth and specialization is often more valuable than breadth. For example, being highly skilled in Python and applying it effectively in areas like machine learning or web development is often more valuable than knowing multiple languages without deep expertise. This concept is known as having <a className='link' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills'>T-shaped skills</a>. It emphasizes building a strong foundation in a specific area (the vertical bar of the &quot;T&quot;) while also having the ability to apply that knowledge broadly (the horizontal bar of the &quot;T&quot;).
              <br />
              <br />
              If your resume feels sparse, try grouping related skills and experiences to ensure your bullet points fully highlight your expertise. Also, think about what skills you want to develop at this stage in your academic journey or early career to create a resume that aligns with your goals.

            <p>
              Your resume should be tailored to a specific job role or a narrow set of roles. For example, if you&apos;re aiming for a role in software engineering, your resume should highlight or emphasize your proficiency in relevant programming languages, technologies, and projects. To stand out further, you can showcase expertise in a particular area — such as frontend development — by emphasizing skills, tools, and experience specific to that specialization. Aligning your resume with the skills and requirements of your target role increases your chances of standing out in a competitive applicant pool.

            <p>
              Your resume should highlight your impact through metrics. A great way to do this is by following the <a className='link' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://simplify.jobs/blog/how-to-use-the-xyz-resume-format/'>XYZ Format</a>. Using numbers is a more compelling way to showcase your impact because they offer concrete evidence of your contributions. When paired with a clear and consistent format, metrics make your resume stand out by making your achievements more measurable and attention-grabbing.

            Your resume is one of the most important tools you have in shaping your career path — especially as a student or fresh grad who has minimal work experience. It&apos;s not just about listing what you&apos;ve done, but getting across who you are as a candidate, what you bring to the table, and why someone should take a chance on you. A clear, well-structured, and thoughtfully tailored resume shows that you understand your strengths, care about your craft, and respect the time of the people reviewing your application. As you learn and gain experience, your resume should evolve alongside you (especially during co-op/internship season). Make sure to reflect and update your resume regularly — the little details are what can turn a good resume into a great one. Please note that these tips on writing a great resume are based on my own experiences and what has worked for me. I recognize that I may have blind spots, so take my advice as one perspective and feel free to adopt whatever resonates with you!
