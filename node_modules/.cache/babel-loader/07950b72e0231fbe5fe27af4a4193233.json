Topics that are introduced challenges one to think very pedantically hence taught me to be very detail-oriented and formalize constructs with clarity. This has allowed me to carry such way of thinking to other courses such as BMEG 371 and CPEN 221. One is exposed to mathematical thinking, logic, and rigorously proving mathematical statements. This course challenged my first principles thinking and really shifted my perspective on mathematics.',\r\n    stack: [],\r\n    sourceCode: '',\r\n    livePreview: 'https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=MATH&course=220',\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n\r\nconst contact = {\r\n  // email is optional - if left empty, contact section won't show up\r\n  email: 'siujaiden@gmail.com',\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport { header, about, projects, skills, courses, contact }\r\n"],"mappings":"AAAA;AAEA,MAAMA,MAAM,GAAG;EACb;EACAC,QAAQ,EAAE,8BAFG;EAGbC,KAAK,EAAE;AAHM,CAAf;AAMA,MAAMC,KAAK,GAAG;EACZ;EACA;EACA;EACAC,IAAI,EAAE,QAJM;EAKZC,IAAI,EAAE,EALM;EAMZC,WAAW,EACT,ybAPU;EAQZC,MAAM,EAAE,oFARI;EASZC,MAAM,EAAE;IACNC,QAAQ,EAAE,wCADJ;IAENC,MAAM,EAAE;EAFF;AATI,CAAd;AAeA,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAG,CACf;AACA;AACA;EACEP,IAAI,EAAE,2BADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,0BAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,SAAD,EAAY,MAAZ,EAAoB,YAApB,EAAkC,MAAlC,EAA0C,KAA1C,EAAiD,OAAjD,EAA0D,gBAA1D,EAA4E,SAA5E,EAAuF,OAAvF,EAAgG,SAAhG,CAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,2CALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAHe,EAWf;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,kBADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,gcAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,MAAD,EAAS,KAAT,EAAgB,YAAhB,EAA8B,OAA9B,EAAuC,cAAvC,EAAuD,KAAvD,EAA8D,SAA9D,CAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,kDALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAXe,EAmBf;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,wCADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,gbAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,QAAD,EAAW,QAAX,EAAqB,SAArB,CAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,6CALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAnBe,EA2Bf;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,wCADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,0BAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,MAAD,EAAS,QAAT,EAAmB,UAAnB,EAA+B,QAA/B,EAAwC,OAAxC,EAAiD,aAAjD,CAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CA3Be,EAmCf;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,sBADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,8ZAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,MAAD,EAAS,QAAT,EAAmB,UAAnB,EAA+B,QAA/B,EAAwC,OAAxC,CAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAnCe,EA2Cf;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,mCADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,mVAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,MAAD,EAAS,QAAT,EAAmB,UAAnB,EAA+B,QAA/B,EAAyC,OAAzC,CAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CA3Ce,EAmDf;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,8BADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,sdAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,MAAD,EAAS,+BAAT,EAA0C,UAA1C,CAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAnDe,EA2Df;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,sCADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,ikBAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,SAAD,EAAY,YAAZ,EAA0B,UAA1B,CAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CA3De,EAmEf;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,yBADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,kjBAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,CAAC,SAAD,EAAY,YAAZ,CAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,sDALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAnEe,CAAjB;AA6EA,MAAMC,MAAM,GAAG,CACb;AACA;AACA,MAHa,EAGL;AACR,QAJa,EAKb,GALa,EAMb,KANa,EAOb,QAPa,EAQb,YARa,EASb,MATa,EAUb,KAVa,EAWb,KAXa,EAYb,KAZa,EAab,OAba,EAaJ;AACT,SAda,EAeb,MAfa,EAgBb,OAhBa,EAiBb,MAjBa,EAkBb,SAlBa,EAmBb,OAnBa,EAoBb,YApBa,EAqBb,OArBa,EAsBb,QAtBa,EAuBb,OAvBa,EAwBb,SAxBa,EAyBb,QAzBa,EA0Bb,KA1Ba,EA0BN;AACP,cA3Ba,EA4Bb,QA5Ba,EA6Bb,KA7Ba,EA8Bb,SA9Ba,EA+Bb,gBA/Ba,EAgCb,iBAhCa,EAiCb,SAjCa,EAkCb,UAlCa,EAmCb,QAnCa,EAoCb,OApCa,EAqCb,OArCa,CAAf;AAwCA,MAAMC,OAAO,GAAG,CACd;EACEZ,IAAI,EAAE,wCADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,8fAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,EAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CADc,EASd;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,8BADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,kFAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,EAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CATc,EAiBd;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,qCADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,qHAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,EAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAjBc,EAyBd;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,8BADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,wgBAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,EAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAzBc,EAiCd;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,2BADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,kjBAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,EAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAjCc,EAyCd;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,gCADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,4qBAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,EAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAzCc,EAiDd;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,yCADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,wFAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,EAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAjDc,EAyDd;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,8BADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,4kBAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,EAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAzDc,EAiEd;EACEV,IAAI,EAAE,6BADR;EAEEE,WAAW,EACT,skBAHJ;EAIEM,KAAK,EAAE,EAJT;EAKEC,UAAU,EAAE,EALd;EAMEC,WAAW,EAAE;AANf,CAjEc,CAAhB;AA2EA,MAAMG,OAAO,GAAG;EACd;EACAC,KAAK,EAAE;AAFO,CAAhB;AAKA,SAASlB,MAAT,EAAiBG,KAAjB,EAAwBQ,QAAxB,EAAkCI,MAAlC,EAA0CC,OAA1C,EAAmDC,OAAnD"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
